# Broward College COP1334C - Intro to Programming in C++
* Final Grade A
* Thoughts: I do not like C++. It is interesting but clunky, class was alright very standard, had to write very very very basic code (professor threatened disciplinary action if we submitted OOP or Functional style programming, because that would 100% mean we were cheating on homework????). But we never even taught those concepts, so we never learned how to code "efficiently". Very slide show heavy, no real explanation of concepts outside of the slides, weird class.
* Don't be that guy, if you're taking this class dont just copy and paste actually learn, use it as a resource if you want, but this code is garbage anyways.
