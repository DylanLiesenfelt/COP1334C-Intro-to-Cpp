# Broward College COP1334C - Intro to Programming in C++
* Final Grade A
* Thoughts: I do not like C++ really it is interesting but clunky, class was alright very standard, how to write very very very basic code (professor threatened displenary action if we submitted OOP or Functional style programming because that would 100% mean we were cheating on homework????). But because of that we never learned how to code "efficiently", very slide show heavy no reall explanation of concepts outside of the slides, weird class.
